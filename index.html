            <p>I have received my master's degree in transportation information engineering and control from Southeast University in June 2024. 
                I am looking forward to the opportunity to become a <code>Ph.D. student</code> in the future so that I can continue addressing problems in the field of transportation research.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Researchers</h3>
            <p>Since I am still a beginner in the field of transportation research, 
                I still have much potential for development in my current research skills and professional cognition. 
                I am eager to consult and communicate with other researchers in the field of transportation. 
                More details of my research can be found

            <h3 class="text-center">Kindred Spirits</h3>
            <p>It is one of my best wishes to connect my pure (or may I say naive) fondness in transport with real-world applications which can inspire and mobilize myself
                in finding solutions towards practical problems. A list of my personal preferred transport games can be found <a href="https://yunqing-jia.github.io/Jerland/more/games/">here</a>.
